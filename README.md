# AI-Coding-Resources

A curated set of documents, patterns, and sample code to guide consistent, AI-assisted development.

This repository is intended as a reusable knowledge base to accelerate project setup, ensure architectural consistency, and streamline prompt design and coding workflows when collaborating with AI tools like ChatGPT.

## ðŸ“‚ What's Inside

### ðŸ“„ Documentation

Core guides designed to be imported into each project:

- `app-description.md` â€“ Example project description and purpose
- `app-initialization-prompt.md` â€“ Sample AI prompt for project setup
- `architecture-blazor-enterprise.md` â€“ Enterprise-grade Blazor architecture
- `architecture-blazor-prototype.md` â€“ Lightweight Blazor prototyping structure
- `auth-supabase.md` â€“ Supabase authentication integration guide
- `blazor-best-practices.md` â€“ Blazor UI and component best practices
- `coding-standards-dot-net.md` â€“ C# and .NET code conventions
- `instructions.md` â€“ AI assistant setup and behavior instructions
- `mcp-servers.md` â€“ Model Context Protocol (MCP) server integration
- `source-control.md` â€“ Source control setup and best practices
- `storage-supabase.md` â€“ Supabase storage integration for .NET
- `supabase.md` â€“ Supabase project setup checklist
- `testing-blazor.md` â€“ Testing Blazor components with bUnit
- `testing-dot-net.md` â€“ Testing standards for .NET class libraries


Each document includes:

- **Instructions**: How and when to apply the content
    
- **Tasks**: Checklists for AI to extract and track per project
    

### ðŸ’» Sample Code

Future samples may include:

- Dependency injection setup
    
- Error boundaries
    
- API client wrappers
    
- Testing scaffolds

## ðŸ§  How to Use

1. **Clone this repo** or import specific documents into your project.
    
2. Use the architecture document that fits your project size (`enterprise` or `prototype`).
    
3. Incorporate the base classes from `BlazorBaseClasses`.
    
4. When using AI tools:
    
    - Paste relevant documents into the context
        
    - Ask the AI to extract tasks or follow best practices
        
    - Let the AI track implementation progress based on the `âœ… Tasks` sections

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Provide consistent scaffolding across projects
    
- Empower developers to effectively use AI as a coding partner
    
- Reduce boilerplate by reusing shared base components and services
    
- Encourage clean architecture and separation of concerns
