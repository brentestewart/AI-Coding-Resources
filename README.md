# AI-Coding-Resources

A curated set of documents, patterns, and sample code to guide consistent, AI-assisted development.

This repository is intended as a reusable knowledge base to accelerate project setup, ensure architectural consistency, and streamline prompt design and coding workflows when collaborating with AI tools like ChatGPT.

## 🧠 How to Use

1. **Clone this repo** or import specific documents into your project.
    
2. Use the architecture document that fits your project size (`enterprise` or `prototype`).
    
3. Using an AI tool to:
    - Read and understand your instructions.md file.
    - Have it create your tasks.md file.
    - Start working the tasks with the AI
    - Let the AI track implementation progress based on the `✅ Tasks` sections

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Provide consistent scaffolding across projects
    
- Empower developers to effectively use AI as a coding partner
    
- Reduce boilerplate by reusing shared base components and services
    
- Encourage clean architecture and separation of concerns
