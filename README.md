# AI-Coding-Resources

A curated set of documents, patterns, and sample code to guide consistent, AI-assisted development.

This repository is intended as a reusable knowledge base to accelerate project setup, ensure architectural consistency, and streamline prompt design and coding workflows when collaborating with AI tools like ChatGPT.

## ðŸ“‚ What's Inside

### ðŸ“„ Documentation

Core guides designed to be imported into each project:

- `coding-standards.md` â€“ C# and .NET code conventions
    
- `blazor-best-practices.md` â€“ UI and component design tips for Blazor
    
- `architecture-enterprise.md` â€“ Enterprise-level layered architecture
    
- `architecture-prototype.md` â€“ Lightweight structure for rapid prototyping
    
- `folder-structure.md` â€“ Recommended folder layout for maintainable projects
    
- _(more coming soon: testing, ai-prompting, state management, etc.)_
    

Each document includes:

- **Instructions**: How and when to apply the content
    
- **Tasks**: Checklists for AI to extract and track per project
    

### ðŸ’» Sample Code

Future samples may include:

- Dependency injection setup
    
- Error boundaries
    
- API client wrappers
    
- Testing scaffolds

## ðŸ§  How to Use

1. **Clone this repo** or import specific documents into your project.
    
2. Use the architecture document that fits your project size (`enterprise` or `prototype`).
    
3. Incorporate the base classes from `BlazorBaseClasses`.
    
4. When using AI tools:
    
    - Paste relevant documents into the context
        
    - Ask the AI to extract tasks or follow best practices
        
    - Let the AI track implementation progress based on the `âœ… Tasks` sections
        

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Provide consistent scaffolding across projects
    
- Empower developers to effectively use AI as a coding partner
    
- Reduce boilerplate by reusing shared base components and services
    
- Encourage clean architecture and separation of concerns
